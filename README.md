# David Jansen webpage

This is a start of a webpage. 
It is maintained through github actions.
I had hoped to use Docker container, but currently not working.
#It uses a Docker container to manage R.
#ghcr.io/david-awam-jansen/david-awam-jansen.github.io:latest
# The content of the docker container can be seen in the Dockerfile.
