Dear Dr. Jansen,

Many thanks for your presubmission enquiry to Current Biology. Having discussed your abstract with my colleagues, I am sorry to say that we cannot encourage the submission of your paper. We appreciate the interest in the issues you are addressing, but our feeling is that the work you describe would be better suited to a rather more specialised journal than Current Biology.

I am sorry not to be able to be more positive on this occasion, but thank you for considering us.

Yours sincerely,

Florian Maderspacher
